I go by the name **Oussama Amri**, experienced and dedicated cybersecurity professional with over a decade of hands-on experience in the field. Known in the community as 'amriunix,' I have honed my skills through years of self-guided learning and practical application, including participation in CTFs challenges. 
My journey has taken me from a pentesting role auditing infrastructure, web applications, and source code audits to network and system security engineering. I have also contributed significantly to the web3 ecosystem by conducting audits and ensuring the security of applications. In my recent role, I have been instrumental in securing the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), managing bug bounty programs, and formulating comprehensive security strategies for startups. My expertise, passion for cybersecurity, and adaptable approach make me a versatile asset in today's ever-evolving threat landscape.
